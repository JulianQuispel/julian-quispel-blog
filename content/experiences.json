Wehkamp, a big online retailer of fashion and living in my hometown Zwolle, seemed like a good fit. For my internship, I compared multiple static site generation frameworks in order to research how Wehkamp can use this technology for their website. I made a custom built version of their existing tech blog on Medium using Gatsby as a proof of concept."

      "description": "I wanted to study something technical. I already coded during high school as a hobby and for small clients, so studying Technical Computer Science at the Unversity of Twente (which is around 60 minutes by train from where I live) seemed like a good choice for me. The Computer Science subjects were not too difficult, however the education has a strong mathematical foundation. Because this was my weak spot I wasn't able to get the required points in order to continue this study. That's why I had to find something else."

That's why I chose to go to Windesheim which is a university of applied sciences. I really liked the more practical approach and the way of teaching as compared to a regular university. I ultimately chose to graduate in the field of software engineering."
